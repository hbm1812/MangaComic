        desc: `The Republic of San Magnolia has been at war with the Empire of Giad for nine years. Though it initially suffered devastating losses to the Empire's autonomous mechanized Legions, the Republic has since developed its own autonomous units, called Juggernauts, which are directed remotely by a Handler. While on the surface, the public believes the war is being fought between machines, in reality, the Juggernauts are being piloted by humans, all of whom are "86"—the designation given to the Colorata minority of San Magnolia. The 86 originally had equal rights, but were persecuted and scapegoated by the dominant Alba race and the Alba-supremacist Republic government to the point where Colorata were both officially designated and popularly considered subhuman. The 86 were not permitted to have personal names and were immured in internment camps in the 86th District (their namesake), all the while being forced to fight in the Republic's war with the Empire to receive better treatment.`,

Having been socially traumatized for his passion, he had closed himself off from everyone. One day at school, his classmate Marin Kitagawa runs into him using a sewing machine for making a doll's costume. After admiring Wakana's doll and praising his work, Marin asks if Wakana could help her create cosplays. Initially, Wakana is nervous about his ability to create cosplay costumes for Marin because of his experience being limited to Hina dolls. However, he agrees to do it.`,
